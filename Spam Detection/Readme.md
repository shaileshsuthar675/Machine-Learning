## Required Libraries

#### Installing the pandas with the help of Miniconda
```bash
  conda create -n name_of_my_env python
```
- This will create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it. To put yourself inside this environment, run:
```bash
  source activate name_of_my_env
```
- On Windows, the command is:
```bash
  activate name_of_my_env
```
- The final step required is to install pandas. This can be done with the following command:
```bash
  conda install pandas
```
- To install a specific pandas version:
```bash
  conda install pandas=0.20.3
```
- To install other packages, IPython, for example:
```bash
  conda install ipython
```
- To install the full Anaconda distribution:
```bash
  conda install anaconda
```
- To install the full Anaconda distribution:
```bash
  conda install anaconda
```
- If you need packages that are available to pip but not conda, then install pip, and then use pip to install those packages:
```bash
  conda install pip
  pip install Django
```
#### Installing from PyPI
```bash
  pip install pandas
```
#### Importing Pandas to your working platform
```bash
  import pandas as PD
```

## Lessons Learned
#### When you are building such kind of code, you'll be able to learn about
- How you can retrieve the data from the comma-separated (CSV) file...
- How you can convert the text data into numeric data for ML model with the help of different-different vectorization method...
- How does the Naives Bayes Classifier work.
