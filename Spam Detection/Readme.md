## Required Libraries

#### Installing the pandas with the help of Miniconda
```bash
  conda create -n name_of_my_env python
```
- This will create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it. To put your self inside this environment run:
```bash
  source activate name_of_my_env
```
- On Windows the command is:
```bash
  activate name_of_my_env
```
- The final step required is to install pandas. This can be done with the following command:
```bash
  conda install pandas
```
- To install a specific pandas version:
```bash
  conda install pandas=0.20.3
```
- To install other packages, IPython for example:
```bash
  conda install ipython
```
- To install the full Anaconda distribution:
```bash
  conda install anaconda
```
- To install the full Anaconda distribution:
```bash
  conda install anaconda
```
- If you need packages that are available to pip but not conda, then install pip, and then use pip to install those packages:
```bash
  conda install pip
  pip install django
```
#### Installing from PyPI
```bash
  pip install pandas
```
#### Importing Pandas in at your working plateform
```bash
  import pandas as pd
```
