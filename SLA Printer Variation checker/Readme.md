## ‚úçÔ∏è Lessons Learned
#### When you are building such kind of code, you'll be able to learn about
-	How to retrieve the data from the CSV file?
-	How the Regression model works here? I‚Äôm using linear regression, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor, and linear support vector regression model.
-	What is RSS (Residual sum of the square)?
-	How to calculate the mean square error and compare the different models to get the best fit model?
-	How does the multi-model regression works?
-	And also how to get best fit prediction model with respect to variable parameters with the help of GridSearchCV.
