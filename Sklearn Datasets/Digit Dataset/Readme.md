## Required Libraries

#### Installing the pandas with the help of Miniconda
```bash
  conda create -n name_of_my_env python
```
- This will create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it. To put yourself inside this environment, run:
```bash
  source activate name_of_my_env
```
- On Windows, the command is:
```bash
  activate name_of_my_env
```
- The final step required is to install pandas. This can be done with the following command:
```bash
  conda install pandas
```
- To install a specific pandas version:
```bash
  conda install pandas=0.20.3
```
- To install other packages, IPython, for example:
```bash
  conda install ipython
```
- To install the full Anaconda distribution:
```bash
  conda install anaconda
```
- To install the full Anaconda distribution:
```bash
  conda install anaconda
```
- If you need packages that are available to pip but not conda, then install pip, and then use pip to install those packages:
```bash
  conda install pip
  pip install Django
```
#### Installing from PyPI
```bash
  pip install pandas
```
#### Importing Pandas to your working platform
```bash
  import pandas as PD
```
## Reference data file
- [Sklearn Digit Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html)

## Lessons Learned
#### When you are building such kind of code, you'll be able to learn about
- how you can retrieve the data from the comma-separated (CSV) file.
- How does the Logistic Regression, Random Forest classifier and SVM classifier work based on multi-features.
- And how the KFold Cross Validation works.


## ‚úçÔ∏è Skills
**Language**
- [python](https://www.python.org/), SQL

**Libraries**
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, [turicreate](https://github.com/apple/turicreate), [Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 


## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Live previews
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross-platform
